INTRODUCTION
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of 
mortality in women in the United States.1 Although the overall 
management of CVD is similar for both genders, gender-based variations exist in the pathophysiology,
2,3 symptoms,4 
presentation, efficacy of diagnostic tests, and response to pharmacological interventions. Some relevant differences"|data_input/cureus/i1947-6094-13-4-185.pdf|0|3dc851440134402d87573a15088a4351
"between men and women are summarized in Table 1 .
Research has shown that women have less obstructive but 
more diffuse coronary artery disease (CAD) and a higher 1-year mortality rate after acute myocardial infarction when 
compared to men.
5 Among women, black women seem to 
have the highest CAD death rates. Finally, both women and 
physicians are less aware of and less proficient in identifying 
CVD in women. Prevention and management of CVD in women,"|data_input/cureus/i1947-6094-13-4-185.pdf|0|51dc59c88fb141e1a0ad643fd6109a21
"therefore, should begin with awareness of the problem and an understanding of the disease’s unique characteristics and challenges in women.
The first guidelines for CVD prevention tailored to women 
were published in 2004 and later updated in 2007 and 2011.

Although the general CVD risk factors in men and women are similar, some exceptions unique to women were detailed in 
these guidelines. The following reviews some of the important"|data_input/cureus/i1947-6094-13-4-185.pdf|0|5e5c6f31324f4f8ea805b0964a33cf41
"risk factors for CVD and the current state of prevention, guidelines, and management of CVD in women.TRADITIONAL RISK FACTORS
Non-Modifiable
Age.  Age is one of the most powerful risk factors for developing 
CVD. The cardioprotective effect of estrogen for premenopausal 
women results in a roughly 8- to 10-year lag in the onset of CAD in women. After the age of 55, the risk for CAD increases similarly in both men and women.

Modifiable
Smoking.  According to the American Heart Association"|data_input/cureus/i1947-6094-13-4-185.pdf|0|08615e84dd1245e2b5c0037f8325f1c0
"(AHA), 13% of women in the United States who are over 18 
years of age are current smokers. Although the percentage of 
women smokers is lower than men, a recent meta-analysis of 75 
cohort studies (approximately 2.4 million individuals) showed a 25% greater risk of CAD in women smokers compared with male smokers (RR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.12-1.39).
1 In a report from 
the Nurses’ Health Study of 85,941 women with a 14-year follow-up, reduction in smoking accounted for a 13% decline in"|data_input/cureus/i1947-6094-13-4-185.pdf|0|bee9f43fb9a2448195d98d5d70438e54

As in men, women should be advised not to smoke and to 
avoid environmental tobacco smoke. Smoking cessation counseling at each encounter, nicotine replacement, and other 
pharmacotherapy options as indicated in conjunction with a 
formal smoking cessation program should be considered.

ABSTRACT: Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among women worldwide. The pathophysiological basis 
of cardiovascular health among men and women is not identical. This leads to variable cardiovascular responses to stimulus and presentation of cardiovascular disease symptoms, both of which can have a direct effect on treatment outcomes."|data_input/cureus/i1947-6094-13-4-185.pdf|0|d0041b09870440d890f6a8f7c4fd9482
Traditionally, the enrollment of women in clinical trials has been minimal, resulting in a lack of gender-specific analysis of clinical trial data|data_input/cureus/i1947-6094-13-4-185.pdf|0|ab41aca9e95b4c00a51ac0ed9416aba0
and, therefore, the absence of concrete risk factor assessment among women. However, scientific progress in the past decade has identified a spectrum of risk factors for cardiovascular diseases that may be specific to women. These risk factors, which may include menopause, hypertensive disease of pregnancy, and depression, confer additional risk in women besides the traditional risk factors. The current state of knowledge and awareness about these risk factors is suboptimal at this time.|data_input/cureus/i1947-6094-13-4-185.pdf|0|41d55617165841138adf447ee9bc4560

Obesity.  According to the 2013 National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey (NHANES) among U.S. adults aged ≥ 20 
years, 37.7% were obese (35% of men and 40.4% of women).3 
The impact of obesity on the development of CAD seems to be greater in postmenopausal women and is thought to be 
due to redistribution of fat around the abdominal area and 
predisposition to metabolic syndrome.

"Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy
Pregnancy is a cardiometabolic stressor that may unmask 
underlying vascular and metabolic abnormalities. Hypertension 
affects approximately 10% of pregnancies and is one of the leading causes of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality.

cardiovascular disease later in life.

particular and CVD both have a state of endothelial dysfunction, 
oxidative stress, inflammatory response, and increased expression of procoagulants. Preeclampsia and CVD also share similar risk factors including obesity, insulin resistance, and 
renal disease. Meta-analyses have shown that preeclampsia"|data_input/cureus/i1947-6094-13-4-185.pdf|2|169e02a6481645109909bb0faa0cad22

and inhibits smooth muscle cell proliferation and matrix deposition following vascular injury.
28 Estrogen also prevents coronary artery 
spasm through vasodilation mediated by both rapid increases in the production of nitric oxide (NO) and the induction of NO 
genes. In addition to its impact on the endothelium and smooth 
muscle cells, estrogen also affects cardiomyocytes. In vitro studies suggest that estrogen prevents cardiomyocyte apoptosis

RISK STRATIFICATION
As previously noted, the current recommendation in the United 
States is to use the pooled cohort risk equation to assess 10-year CVD risk.
11 However, in the future, nontraditional risk factors 
and markers such as depression, radiation exposure, pregnancy complications, depression, and history of autoimmune disease 
should also be considered. Furthermore, whether or not the"|data_input/cureus/i1947-6094-13-4-185.pdf|4|f73beb47e03f4396a3ff3070f71dbc3f

have similar recommendations for men and women.11
CAROTID INTIMA-MEDIA THICKNESS, CORONARY CALCIUM SCORE,

Ten-year risk assessments still have room for improvement; thus"|data_input/cureus/i1947-6094-13-4-185.pdf|4|b32cedb5287a4ffe96c8e9858d094b38

benefit occurs in both men and women. Therefore, statins are"|data_input/cureus/i1947-6094-13-4-185.pdf|5|5162569a2f3640d8a55cdeab31b1e77f
"valuable in both men and women in the primary and secondary prevention of CVD. Given the lack of statin safety data in pregnancy, women of childbearing age need to be thoroughly counseled on contraceptive use to avoid pregnancy while on 
statin therapy.
Role of Aspirin
Like statin therapy, secondary prevention of CVD with the use"|data_input/cureus/i1947-6094-13-4-185.pdf|5|6b9f3622e10044c2a7c5ecaeba55658a

dosing of aspirin or placebo. After a 10-year follow-up, low-"|data_input/cureus/i1947-6094-13-4-185.pdf|5|8dc9a0d8f6b04711857b86a08f40ed7e

years old. However, those assigned to aspirin therapy had a 
higher bleeding risk; therefore, the risk and benefits of aspirin therapy should be weighed, particularly if a patient has risk factors for bleeding.

A recently published study evaluated the long-term safety and efficacy of low-dose aspirin in patients with type 2 DM for primary prevention of CVD.
37 After a median follow-up period of 
10.3 years, low-dose aspirin did not improve CV outcomes but did increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. A postulated 
hypothesis for this negative result is that statin use among these 
individuals and a lower LDL-C may have reduced the previously known aspirin benefit."|data_input/cureus/i1947-6094-13-4-185.pdf|5|bcff9d8a552c4d848b2be3e90f27c8bd
"Nevertheless, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force 
recommended the use of low-dose aspirin for primary 
prevention in both women and men aged 50 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk without an increased risk of bleeding (Grade B recommendation). Other preventive 
recommendations, including management of hypertension and 
diabetes and smoking cessation, are similar in women and men.

"RESEARCH ENROLLMENT OF WOMEN
Women in cardiovascular clinical trials have been underrepresented, resulting in therapeutic strategies that have been mostly extrapolated from studies on men.
38 With 
large single-sex studies like the WHS and the WHI, female participation has increased substantially; however, in mixed-gender trials, women on average represent less than a third of all participants.

In addition, women manifest CVD later in life, and an age-
gender bias may be present during the study enrollment process.

Preventive therapies for CVD are essential in reducing mortality and preserving cardiovascular health in women. Although several advances have been made in primary and secondary"|data_input/cureus/i1947-6094-13-4-185.pdf|5|2fec5246267142d2b011a86e3fbc5aa6

KEY POINTS
• Female patients are likely to be treated less aggressively and have fewer coronary interventions performed for similar presentations compared to men despite the 
similarity of overall risk in postmenopausal women and 
men.
• Comprehensive understanding of the hormonal and genomic basis for the pathophysiologic differences of CVD and symptom presentation in women is key to 
providing gender-specific care."|data_input/cureus/i1947-6094-13-4-185.pdf|5|5b67d004d784412e90c78a54d4e3ad77

• Encouraging more research participation by women will

One of the best studied diets for cardiovascular health is the Mediterranean diet. This consists of 
fish, monounsaturated fats from olive oil, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes/nuts, and 
moderate alcohol consumption. The Mediterranean diet has been shown to reduce the burden, or 
even prevent the development, of cardiovascular disease, breast cancer, depression, colorectal"|data_input/cureus/nihms-635483.pdf|0|0442cce1568c405c81ac3fbc7d938c9a

known to improve surrogates of cardiovascular disease, such as waist-to-hip ratio, lipids, and 
markers of inflammation, as well as primary cardiovascular disease outcomes such as death and 
events in both observational and randomized controlled trial data. These enhancements easily rival

Introduction
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the world 
regardless of race, ethnicity, or gender, and costs related to cardiovascular disease in the 
United States are expected to surpass $300 billion in 2010 ( 1). Optimistically, simple and 
cost-effective steps such as a proper diet should be able to alleviate the obesity epidemic and"|data_input/cureus/nihms-635483.pdf|1|d50a91e50fc748c1a93610e7353ec4b5
"the resultant cardiovascular disease burden as it is estimated that lifestyle choices can 
account for up to 40% of premature cardiovascular disease deaths ( 2). The Mediterranean 
diet – consisting of fish, unsaturated fats, whole grains, fruits and vegetables, nuts and 
legumes – has consistently been shown to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality as 
well as surrogate markers in meta-analyses, cohort studies, and randomized control trials"|data_input/cureus/nihms-635483.pdf|1|14382570400b442dabcd428aa9198665

demonstrated by highly proven and advertised interventions, and approach measures such as

limit calories, but rather emphasizes an abundance of plant foods, olive oil as the principal 
source of fat, limited dairy products, consumption of moderate amounts of fish, poultry, and 
wine, low amounts of red meat, and fresh fruit daily – consistent with current American 
Heart Association (AHA) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommendations for

grains, oats, and barley, reduce cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality through

foods ( 68). While the ESC does not have specific guidelines or recommendations regarding"|data_input/cureus/nihms-635483.pdf|6|2cc28a0086c94e66ade42b52e54ed1b4

Predominantly, the data regarding the beneficial effect of moderate nut consumption is 
positive, yet similar convincing evidence cannot support the same for legumes. Few meta-
analyses or RCTs describe the cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality impact of 
nuts, but most early observational data point to a reduction in cardiovascular disease risk

their roots, comprised of a wide variety of sources and types difficult to carefully study. 
These seeds are considered low-glycemic and a useful dietary source of protein and fiber."|data_input/cureus/nihms-635483.pdf|7|2b4d95fc0e144475be99181b9c2f9219
"Initial observational studies showed legume and soy intake to be beneficial toward 
preventing cardiovascular disease ( 87) as NHANES data showed an 11% reduction in 
cardiovascular disease in women who consumed legumes four or more times weekly over 
those who consumed legumes one, or fewer, times weekly. Similar observational data has 
been reported out of Japan ( 88) and China ( 89).Widmer et al. Page 8

"RCT data rarely addresses hard cardiovascular disease endpoints, and the grouped data only 
shows marginal benefits with regard to lipid levels, blood pressure, or endothelial function. 
Small RCTs in low-moderate risk patients show little ( 90) to no change in lipid levels ( 91, 
92). Yet one meta-analysis shows a 5% reduction in LDL levels in patients who were 
randomized to high legume intake ( 93), however this reduction was not noted to have an"|data_input/cureus/nihms-635483.pdf|8|75292b19faf447e2a63e004fc326a439

pressure in patients with moderate hypertension ( 94). And a recent RCT shows no benefit of 
soy on NO bioavailability or BP in moderately hypertensive, post-menopausal women ( 95), 
consistent with prior meta-analyses mentioned above ( 93).
However, subsequent meta-analyses have been less convincing regarding cardiovascular"|data_input/cureus/nihms-635483.pdf|8|9d7804957096454f9cbaee5fbd31d652

inflammatory and vaso-protective benefit, a multitude of studies has examined the effect of 
soy on endothelial function. A fairly recent meta-analysis of RCTs shows no benefit of soy 
on endothelial function ( 96); however when the age-related results are adjusted for baseline 
endothelial function, there is a moderate benefit of soy supplementation. A larger sample of"|data_input/cureus/nihms-635483.pdf|8|52b14b7662be452d9f2e5f078327a17d
"RCTs studies showed no benefit from soy supplementation on normotensive patients ( 97) 
and an earlier meta-analysis mirrored these findings ( 98). Thus, despite an abundance of 
observational data, and recent, well-designed RCTs and subsequent meta-analyses, we find 
little direct evidence that legume intake, alone, has direct cardiovascular disease benefit. 
Interestingly, while nutritionally similar and usually grouped together with nuts – which do"|data_input/cureus/nihms-635483.pdf|8|b63ab1c985194df6a78d1b6e8a171349
"have a positive cardiovascular disease impact – It could be hypothesized that legume intake 
must be part of the Mediterranean diet as a whole, and cannot be supplemented in isolation 
for cardiovascular disease protection.
Conclusions
The Mediterranean Diet is arguably the best-studied and most evidence-based diet to prevent 
not only CVD but also other chronic diseases, as it has become the standard for healthy 
eating and a dietary template of particular value. The primary advantage of the"|data_input/cureus/nihms-635483.pdf|8|cc04583bebea49ea97cb08d9874c5485
"Mediterranean diet appears to lie in its synergy among various cardio-protective nutrients 
and foods ( 99). Indeed, the diet and, to a lesser degree, its components have been found to 
reduce cardiovascular disease risk by mechanisms including reduction of surrogates of 
cardiovascular disease such as blood pressure, lipids, endothelial dysfunction, glucose, BMI, 
and waist circumference as well as by providing increased NO bioavailability, antioxidant"|data_input/cureus/nihms-635483.pdf|8|995f859e339b48cc9a55198d4560eab9
"properties, as well as anti-inflammatory effects (Figure 2).
As illustrated in this review, the Mediterranean diet has proven secondary cardiovascular 
disease prevention benefit and improvements in surrogate markers for cardiovascular 
disease as evidenced by copious observational, RTC, and even meta-analyses. Certain 
constituents of the Mediterranean diet, including fish and nuts, have established 
cardiovascular morbidity/mortality benefits (Table 1), which can possibly be noted in"|data_input/cureus/nihms-635483.pdf|8|e318729ed90b408bb21a0efb1b6ee125
"isolation from the remainder of the Mediterranean diet. Both observational and RCT data 
documented improvement in cardiovascular disease prevention (Table 1) with constituents 
of the Mediterranean diet which should be consumed in moderation to ensure a balanced 
diet and avoid caloric excess. Preventive measures depend strongly upon length of time Widmer et al. Page 9

"followed—it is a life-long commitment, not something that can be done episodically. 
Duration may be more important than intensity, especially because high intensities are 
difficult to sustain. Simply changing one or following a few dietary constituents does not 
exclude detrimental effects of the rest of the diet or lifestyle. This is, of course, why the 
dietary pattern is much more important than the effects of individual constituents. In fact,"|data_input/cureus/nihms-635483.pdf|9|52811eef53034f98b7b9b0fee1f2c9db

Mediterranean diet – that is comprised of a group of foods considered beneficial for

Epidemiology of HIV and cardiovascular disease
With access to life-preserving combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), people with HIV 
are living longer and could have increased risk for diseases of ageing, such as cardiovascular 
disease. A model based on the AIDS Therapy Evaluation in the Netherlands (ATHENA) 
cohort showed that the median age of people with HIV on ART will increase from 43∙9"|data_input/cureus/nihms-1587024.pdf|1|4c20058aab6040fcb838992e157b57e8

diagnosed with cardiovascular disease.3
The increase in relative risk of myocardial infarction among people with HIV ranges 
from 20% to 100%, compared with people without HIV (table 1). This increased relative 
risk persists among those with viral suppression,14 exists for type 1 and type 2 acute 
myocardial infarction events;15 and might be more pronounced in women than in men (for"|data_input/cureus/nihms-1587024.pdf|1|8ecc31a8533a4e4c9413b3b094d81387

lower among people with fewer risk factors for this condition, the relative risk of acute 
myocardial infarction remains higher among people with HIV including those with good 
cardiac health.17 Ischaemic stroke accounts for approximately 80% of all strokes in people 
with HIV ,18 with the rest accounted for by haemorrhagic stroke."|data_input/cureus/nihms-1587024.pdf|1|e084a2d036544a7784e245a485446bc7

First, more research is needed to identify optimal thrombotic risk reduction strategies 
for HIV in regions where the comorbid burden of cardiovascular disease and HIV is 
greatest. Second, lifestyle modification, particularly smoking cessation and reduction, 
should be emphasised in HIV care to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk.

"Conclusion
In summary, a geographical imbalance between HIV disease burden and the populations 
included in published HIV-related cardiovascular disease research exists. There is strong 
evidence linking HIV infection to myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure. There 
are scarce data that also link HIV infection to peripheral artery disease and sudden cardiac 
death. Although mechanisms for these associations might be the same for all people with"|data_input/cureus/nihms-1587024.pdf|13|30600b702aac44c19f38b69d1d5ed9c6
"HIV , the distribution of cardiovascular disease risk factors varies by geographical location. 
These variations result in different profiles of cardiovascular disease risk in low-income and 
middle-income countries compared with high-income countries. To reduce cardiovascular 
disease risk globally among people with HIV calls for thoughtful balancing of public and 
individual health approaches, evidence-informed strategies, expert health-care and patient"|data_input/cureus/nihms-1587024.pdf|13|64dfd079b76949fc8c3ed07105885d35

Results: There are known variable cardiovascular risk factors to be claimed as those that should be changed in order to achieve a better prevention of cardiovascular disease development. But, most papers are informative and they didn’t incorporate exact measures for each variable risk factor. Our paper shows exact measures for each variable cardiovascular risk factor that should be incorporate in everyday practice of family practitioners and cardiologists as well.

mellitus. 1. INTRODUCTION  Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD) are heart and circulatory system disorders. It is a set of heterogeneous diseases whose underlying cause of development is most often atherosclero-sis [1, 2]. CVD are chronic diseases that are gradually evolv-ing throughout life, and are asymptomatic for a long time. Usually only the advanced disease causes symptoms or the first symptom can be sudden death [3]. For years they have been the leading cause of premature mortality across the|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|0|5636167f693144289a43090a80fe2bf9
"leading cause of premature mortality across the world. It is estimated that by the year 2030, 23.6 million people will die of CVD per year. There is a mild tendency to decrease mortality and incidence of CVD in north western and southern Europe [2].  CVD causes 49% of mortality in Europe, which is the most important cause of premature mortality and Disability Adjusted Life Years (""DALYS"") in Europe, thus creating a great public health importance on this topic. Approximately € 192 billion is the"|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|0|5858afe30c1d44558b8f8632fc6ad382
on this topic. Approximately € 192 billion is the cost of annual health care for CVD in the European Union [4]. *Address correspondence to this author at the Health Care Center Zagreb, Laginjina 16, Zagreb, Croatia; Tel: 0038514604149; E-mail: sonja.francula-zaninovic@dzz-centar.hr  CVD are caused by multiple factors. Some of them are invariable (age, gender, genetic heritage), others are variable, that is, they can be affected (smoking tobacco, physical inac-tivity, poor eating habits,|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|0|7d195a7264ce4966b18586d29bf4e72b
physical inac-tivity, poor eating habits, elevated blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity) [4].  For the reduction of the CVD mortality rate in highly developed countries, controlling risk factors (45-75%) and proper CVD treatment (25-55%) are responsible [5-7].  This review aims to summarize the available information on measurable variable CVD risk factors through existing literature and integrate them with healthy tips that can be managed in everyday practice. 2. PREVENTION OF|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|0|030fa1f4780d4478867ffb13a918851f
be managed in everyday practice. 2. PREVENTION OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES  Prevention of CVD is defined as a coordinated pool of activity at the population level or individual level with the aim of eliminating or reducing to the lowest level of CVD incidence and their consequences [8].  The report of the Expert Committee for the Prevention of the CVD and WHO established in 1982 measures of preven-tion that need to have 3 components of the strategy [9]:|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|0|705c84ed714d42fe91d0ad1ccbc27c79
154    Current Cardiology Reviews, 2018, Vol. 14, No. 3 Frančula-Zaninović and Nola 1. Population strategy - Lifestyle habits and environ-mental factors, socioeconomic determinants that may cause CVD development, affect these activities at the level of the entire population [8, 10]. 2. High-risk strategy - Identification of high risk indi-viduals and measures that will reduce their risk fac-tors. 3. Secondary prevention - Prevention of the occurrence or reoccurrence and progression of disease in|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|1|7d57cd93bd6e4101a876d72f6789f4d8
or reoccurrence and progression of disease in patients with already proven CVD.  High-risk and secondary strategies are directed at indi-viduals and must be an integral part of our clinical practice [9]. The population strategy is focused on the entire commu-nity, and is an integral part of food, transport, employment, education and health policies and other policies at the level of Europe, the state, the region and the local community. Population and clinical approach should be complementary,|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|1|e76cf8b448f34c90936c535667807138
and clinical approach should be complementary, but the population strategy is the basis for reducing the inci-dence of CVD in Europe. It focuses on social and economic determinants of illness through political activities. It tends to change the lifestyle habits: reducing the number of smokers, increasing physical activity, promoting healthy living habits. Investment and political will are needed to achieve these goals [8-11].   According to the latest guidelines of the European Cardi-ology|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|1|0414eedd67e94c91b7adedc3f33436c9
the latest guidelines of the European Cardi-ology Society (ESC) CVD prevention, the focus is on the population approach to prevention, on disease-specific inter-ventions, female population, younger individuals and ethnic minorities. The emphasis is on the whole life cycle of CVD prevention [12] (Figs. 1 and 2 and Table 1). 3. MONITORING MEASURABLE CHANGES OF FACTORS IMPORTANT FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES DEVELOPMENT  CVD prevention measures must be an integral part of everyday medical work to|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|1|761528eb89e242078449b972d8a6e2ea
be an integral part of everyday medical work to achieve optimal results. It is there-fore important to define CVD prevention priorities. CVD prevention guidelines provide the procedures for defining the preventive measures to be taken, taking into account the health policies of individual countries and the incidence of CVD in individual countries in order to achieve unambigu-ous access to patients.  It is most important to have a consistent approach with defined monitoring parameters based on|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|1|2f7b4fbadf2543889be4b51842e10dd0
with defined monitoring parameters based on which an individ-ual's risk assessment will be carried out. The risk assessment is one of the most important measures that define all future treatments of patients.   Reduction of CVD morbidity and mortality is the goal of clinical and population preventative strategies. Since CVD are multifactorial, it is necessary to monitor and act upon several different risk factors at the same time. Health professionals use the algorithm according to ESC|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|1|f293301f1d6e4c64821875fa7f150779
professionals use the algorithm according to ESC guide-lines in their work on CVD prevention. The first ESC pre-vention guidelines were published in 1994 and since then they have been revised several times. The last are published 2016.   At the same time, the existence of multiple risk factors multiplies the risk of CVD, and the risk of myocardial in-farction progressively increases [13-17]. Therefore, the esti-mate of the CVD risk is of the most importance in the opti-mal management of|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|1|46fae8445e514d91aa2bf025216033b5
the most importance in the opti-mal management of prevention and treatment [18].  Stratification of CVD risk is important because there are people who do not yet have manifest atherosclerotic disease but can develop CVD [12]. Total CVD risk means that an individual is likely to develop a fatal cardiovascu-lar event for a certain period of time. It is important for the physician to be able to assess the risk quickly and to make a quick decision on further treatment (evidence-based management).|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|1|c7a08ab1e39a4a188d0766631c5b9093
on further treatment (evidence-based management). To help diagnose and monitor indi-viduals who have increased risk for developing CVD, there are developed monitoring models that are being used today in Europe in the form of Systemic Coronary Risk Estimation (SCORE) tables (Figs. 1 and 2). SCORE tables are used only for people without known CVD. Peo-ple with already manifest atherosclerotic vascular disease are in the group of high CVD risk and as such should be treated [19].  Recommendations|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|1|b3cf0e534ca943c48f73299917c9b457
as such should be treated [19].  Recommendations for using the SCORE table [8, 13]: - For apparently healthy adults (>40g.) without signs of CVD, Diabetes Mellitus (DM), chronic kidney dis-ease, familial hypercholesterolemia, because these patients are already high risk and are therefore the priority for intensive counseling on risk factors. - Evaluate for each individual the total ten-year risk of death by sex, smoking, age, systolic blood pressure and total cholesterol. - Low risk individuals|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|1|81939924486a40b281f72d4a31469913
and total cholesterol. - Low risk individuals should be advised to maintain such status, and those with an estimated risk >5% should dedicate particular attention to reduce it. - Define the relative risk for people under the age of 40. - The effect of cholesterol, smoking status and systolic pressure can be estimated from the table.  The decision on treatment strategy depends on the initial risk level. Categorization into different groups of total CVD risks is agreed but is recommended for its|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|1|248ebd1942814c42b0696d08b86399cc
CVD risks is agreed but is recommended for its simplicity [4]. The total CVD risk may be higher than that shown in the tables under the following circumstances: - If an individual moves to an older age group. - In asymptomatic patients with signs of atherosclerotic disease (computer tomography, ultrasound). - In individuals with significant positive family history of early cardiovascular deaths. - In individuals with low high density lipoproteins (HDL) cholesterol, high triglycerides, glucose|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|1|080325de3c7d40cd98e0ab3bf001ce8f
(HDL) cholesterol, high triglycerides, glucose intoler-ance, elevated C-Reactive Protein (CRP), elevated fi-brinogen, elevated homocysteine, elevated apolipo-protein B (APOB), elevated lipoproteins, and obese people with the sedentary lifestyle [8].  Separate tables are compiled for the high and low risk countries of Europe of high and low risk, and in the future for each country will be able to define individualized risk tables.|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|1|585a310b7f0c49789765eb26138b81c5

The first is the direction of pre-ventive efforts toward those who will be most likely|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|2|f39dab0f745e43078b42d5b19c332131
efforts toward those who will be most likely to bene-fit. The second is the reassurance and avoidance of side ef-fects in lower-risk persons who will derive less benefit [20]. In the most people, CVD is the product of more than 1 risk factors. A combination of several factors result in much higher total risk [20]. Therefore, SCORE system help to es-timate total risk. For young person, we use relative risk esti-mation (they can be at low absolute but high relative risk) [20]. We must encourage|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|2|fe9db32e55b94bf7bb8a1602ac64cb0d
but high relative risk) [20]. We must encourage risk evaluation and management because it improves the primary prevention of CVD. 4. VARIABLE RISK FACTORS OF CARDIOVASCU-LAR DISEASES  Factors contributing to the development of atherosclero-sis and CVD are called CVD risk factors. Their action is multiplied thus presenting a big public health problem. CVD risk factors may be variable and invariable.  Invariable risk factors are those we cannot influence (age and gender, men over age 45 and women|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|2|b5f032b8a03046f98d21175cafb996f3
(age and gender, men over age 45 and women over 55 years re-spectively in menopause, inheritance-positive family his-tory).  Variable risk factors are those we can influence by changing bad habits. Variable risk factors include: smoking, inadequate physical activity, elevated blood pressure, in-creased body weight (obesity), increased levels of fat in the blood (cholesterol, triglyceride), DM.  The goal of managing the variable risk factors is to re-duce CVD morbidity and mortality. Clinical|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|2|43453d2f8a514c80a33aa1ad87dde623
to re-duce CVD morbidity and mortality. Clinical studies: Framingham, Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT) [21], Asia Pacific Cohort Studies Collaboration (APCSC) [22], INTERHEART [23] has shown that multiple risk factors multiply CVD risk and the risk of myocardial infarction progressively increases. Thus, CVD are multifac-torial diseases, and these have to be monitored at several levels and in particular, an important estimate of variable risk factors is in diagnosis, monitoring|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|2|748fc0ae4f9540b99b2387c5ec4e9efe
variable risk factors is in diagnosis, monitoring and treatment [24].  The influence of variable risk factors at the risk of myo-cardial infarction has been demonstrated in the major inter-national clinical study INTERHEART, which included 52 countries and the results of which were published in 2004. It has proven the importance of preventive measures to reduce the incidence of myocardial infarction [25]. According to the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Guidelines, recom-mendations are|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|2|c6cdcb69a6b34d12a32c3734ee4839f8
Cardiology (ESC) Guidelines, recom-mendations are given for managing variable CVD risk fac-tors in the way presented below. 4.1. Smoking  Smoking cigarettes is a dominant risk factor for cardio-vascular and non-cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. It is estimated that by the year 2025, there will be 1.6 billion smokers in the world, and that 10 million people a year will die for smoking [10]. Unfortunately, there is still a rise in smokers among women and adolescents in Europe [12, 26]. The|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|2|77909c09c6bb4f1895dfd4edfd5ebec6
women and adolescents in Europe [12, 26]. The ten-year risk of fatal cardiovascular events is doubled in smokers [12]. Passive smoking increases the risk of CVD [8, 12, 27].|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|2|e551275ff8e54e718b528361af682d5d
156    Current Cardiology Reviews, 2018, Vol. 14, No. 3 Frančula-Zaninović and Nola  Smoking is one of the preventable risk factors with the greatest contribution in the development of CVD and as such must be the most important factor that the physician tends to reduce.   There are a number of measures we can use to help the patient and our recommendations range from individual ap-proaches through group therapies to medication approaches: 1. Self-help technique. 2. Individual advisory. 3. Group|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|3|3f1c3ab98cbc4966a0dd1da4c98ee17d
"technique. 2. Individual advisory. 3. Group therapy. 4. Substitution therapy with nicotine. 5. Antidepressants (smoking cessation and nicotine up-set can provoke depression). 6. Family support and spouse.  Promoting non-smoking includes social programs as part of health promotion activities. Many European countries have declared a ""smoke-free"" zone (ban on smoking at the workplace, in public institutions, restaurants ...), which is very important in stimulating individual efforts to stop"|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|3|c8a4be9bc9bc43c5b224f042485edcb3
in stimulating individual efforts to stop smok-ing [9]. The goal is to reach Europe as a smoking-free Europe by 2030 [8]. Public health measures and legislation are also important: smoking ban, tobacco tax, media cam-paigns ... High taxes on all tobacco products have been shown to be an effective measure to reduce youth smoking [8]. Children in schools should be taught with healthy life-style habits, including noxiousness smoking lectures, en-couraging young people not to start smoking or to|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|3|6d046c4c31304c5bb5f2ccce5a4d5e73
young people not to start smoking or to stop smoking [8]. 4.2. Physical (in) Activity  Physical inactivity is a risk factor of CVD development, but also the development of a number of other chronic dis-eases. Even 60% of the world's population does not meet the minimum recommended 30 minutes daily of moderate physical activity. The CVD risk is increased by 1.5 times in people living a sedentary lifestyle. Physical inactivity causes 2 million deaths per year and 22% of all ischemic heart|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|3|34cabee536be4e7fb1793657efaa74ae
deaths per year and 22% of all ischemic heart dis-ease [28]. Due to the increased physical inactivity of young people, a higher increase in CVD is expected.  Regular physical activity is protective and has many benefits: it directly affects the reduction of already existing vascular lesions and reduces other risk factors (reduces body weight, reduces lipid levels, blood sugar, reduces arterial pressure) and thus decreases the incidence of coronary dis-ease [8, 9].  It reduces the progression of|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|3|9d436967b6a94a7498f1fa223bc6f1fd
dis-ease [8, 9].  It reduces the progression of atherosclerosis, protects the patient from oxidative stress, increases insulin sensitivity, decreases the incidence of malignant arrhythmias, balances the vegetative system [9, 29-31]. Consequently reduces total and CV mortality.  Promoting physical activity should start already in child-hood. In all age groups, physical activity is an important part of preventative CVD measures.  Cardiovascular patients, especially after acute coronary syndrome,|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|3|408a0393df7640d2a20cb02a17f4eaff
especially after acute coronary syndrome, intervention on the coronary arteries or heart sur-gery, should undergo a CVD rehabilitation program during which they will be monitored, and tested using treadmill bicycle exercise with Electrocardiography (ECG) and blood pressure monitoring. The patient should monitor his fre-quency on the pulse monitor while exercising at home. Coronary patients with low clinical risk should moderately or intensively exercise 30 minutes 3 to 5 times a week. Coronary|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|3|bd2295ca19f14ae783c6aaaa7650a800
exercise 30 minutes 3 to 5 times a week. Coronary patients with moderate to high clinical risk should strictly individually adjust the exercise program. Even the heaviest patients have benefit from low intensity exercise, but under the supervision of experts. Exercising encourages their self-reliance and reduces depression [8].  Regular exercise is important in primary and secondary CVD prevention. Before starting the exercise, to determine the intensity of the exercise, it is important to|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|3|e323eee6acec48268aff5c073d979acb
the intensity of the exercise, it is important to stratify the CV risk to prevent possible unwanted cardiovascular events. According to the ESC Guidelines, the following recommen-dations are [8]: 1. Healthy adults all ages of 2.5 to 5h a week of moder-ate physical activity or 1 to 2.5h per week of intense physical activity. 2. Healthy adults who lead a sedentary lifestyle should be encouraged to start with a light exercise intensity. 3. Patients with coronary heart disease (myocardial|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|3|7b45e09f516042148f85e6d301ef4dd5
Patients with coronary heart disease (myocardial in-farction, after aortic coronary bypass or coronary in-tervention with stable angina pectoris, with stable heart failure) need 3 or more times a week moderate to intense aerobic exercise for 30 minutes. 4. Patients with coronary heart disease conducting a sedentary lifestyle should begin with light exercise af-ter CVD risk assessing. 4.3. Blood Pressure  Blood pressure (BP) is commonly defined as persistent blood pressure 140/90 mmHg and above,|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|3|d6288066949249a5a7acc95398390be5
persistent blood pressure 140/90 mmHg and above, and affects one quarter of the adult population [9].  Arterial hypertension (AH) is one of the most important preventable factors of premature mortality in the world. AH is also the most important independent risk factor of CVD. In most developed countries more than 30% of adults suffer from AH. Primary prevention should start at the earliest age [32].  Arterial hypertension is a risk factor of CVD, but also mortality from coronary illness or|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|3|9473f0ea1cce4feebd7be6e5be7c0f98
CVD, but also mortality from coronary illness or stroke [8, 33]. CVD risk doubled in every increase in BP: diastolic for 10 mmHg and systolic for 20 mmHg [33]. Classification of BP and AH according to ESC guidelines [14]:  Systolic BP (mmHg)  Diastolic BP (mmHg) Optimal BP <120 and  <80 Normal BP 120-129 and / or 80-84 Highly Normal BP 130-139 and / or 85-89 1st degree AH 140-159 and / or 90-99 2nd degree AH 160-179 and / or 100-109|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|3|ba0c0cc3b734482b9625bc00af73501c
CVD Measurable Risk Factors Current Cardiology Reviews, 2018, Vol. 14, No. 3     157 3rd degree AH ≥180 and / or ≥110 Isolated systolic AH ≥140 and <90   According to the new 2017 American Heart Association (AHA) Guidelines for high blood pressure in adults AH and BP are classified [34]:  Systolic BP (mmHg)  Diastolic BP (mmHg) Normal BP <120 and    <80 Elevated  BP 120-129 and    <80 AH  Stage 1 130-139 or     80-89 AH Stage 2 ≥140  ≥90   In order to prevent AH, it is important to encourage the|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|4|c20c2bbc85ba423ebb0a4c64cf758931
to prevent AH, it is important to encourage the following measures in childhood: reducing salt intake, regu-lar physical activity and prevent obesity. BP can be reduced by changing life habits and pharmacotherapy.  Life habits in BP reduction include: - Reduced intake of salt in food (<5g/day). - Decrease in intake of alcoholic beverages (10-30g/day). - Mediterranean diet type (increased omega 3 fatty acid intake). - Increased physical activity. - Smoking cessation. - Body weight regulation.|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|4|4f427010f962479bab5cfc67cb710c85
- Smoking cessation. - Body weight regulation.  According to the ESC guidelines, the goal is to lower BP to 140/90 mmHg or to lower than 140/85 mmHg in diabet-ics. The beginning of pharmacotherapy will depend on the estimated total CVD risk and the degree of AH. In the case of CVD already present or the target organs are damaged, pharmacotherapy starts immediately and the choice of anti-hypertensive will depend on the already present disease [8, 33].  AHA guidelines recommend healthy lifestyle|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|4|5d8c7e7b49e944bdbd7b8159c0cf41fd
33].  AHA guidelines recommend healthy lifestyle for all. They recommend one BP lowering medication for the pa-tients with AH stage 1 if the 10-year risk for heart disease and stroke assessment is >10% or they have CVD, diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease. For the patients with AH stage 2 they recommend immediately two medications of different class [34].   4.4. Eating Habits  There is a well-known association between eating habits and CVD risk. One of the first clinical studies to|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|4|da3f1d1c45964db38032b9ae3e250f23
"CVD risk. One of the first clinical studies to prove this connection is the study of ""Seven Countries Study"" [35]. It has shown a correlation between poor eating habits (food rich in saturated fats) and the onset of ischemic heart disease [8].  Healthy nutrition is the basis of CV prevention. Food habits affect the level of fat and blood sugar, BP, body weight. Healthy nutrition reduces the risk of other chronic diseases. It is considered that the Mediterranean type of nu-trition satisfies all"|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|4|b001f9bc99e24c23bf531788cebb3ba2
Mediterranean type of nu-trition satisfies all the healthy nutritional recommendations [9]. Healthy food must contain [12, 36-40]: 1. Saturated fatty acids <10% of total daily energy in-take; replace them with polyunsaturated fatty acids. 2. Transfat acids should be avoided (they are found in the factory processed food) and should be <1% of the total energy input. 3. Salt <5g per day. 4. 30 to 45 grams of fiber per day (whole grains, fruits, vegetables). 5. 200g of fruit a day (2 to 3 meals per|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|4|1e8470b1e5ae4b27a7494431c0a22162
5. 200g of fruit a day (2 to 3 meals per day). 6. 200g vegetables a day (2-3 servings per day). 7. Fish at least 2x per week (1 meal a week blue fish). 8. Alcoholic beverages: 2 glasses a day (20g/day) for men and 1 glass per day (10g/day) for women. Table 1. Stratification of CVD risk.

158    Current Cardiology Reviews, 2018, Vol. 14, No. 3 Frančula-Zaninović and Nola  According to the new ESC Guidelines on CVD preven-tion, a population approach has been introduced according to dietary measures, physical activity and smoking. Structural measures such as limiting marketing and taxing unhealthy food, reducing the price of healthy food and making them better labelled to make it easier for consumers to view and choose (“consumer-friendly”) are important [9]. Healthy lifestyles|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|5|94f4e21f2d444dcba350c0056af33e40
are important [9]. Healthy lifestyles should be stimulated in the community, schools and workplaces [8].  The general recommendations of a healthy diet according to ESC recommendations are [9]: 1. A varied well-balanced diet. 2. Proper energy intake with regular physical activity contributes to good body weight control. 3. Regularly consume fish. 4. Eat fruits, vegetables, cereals and whole grain prod-ucts. 5. Consume non-fat milk products. 6. Eat unleavened meat, avoid fried. 7. Use vegetable|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|5|dc4ca6c342c04fde8cb06fc46b70ea08
unleavened meat, avoid fried. 7. Use vegetable oils rich in mono and polyunsatu-rated fats. 8. Avoid salty and factory processed foods.  Legislative regulations (except, of course, existing) are needed to limit trans fat acid and salt in food products. The food industry can significantly contribute to salt reduction in processed food [8]. 4.5. Obesity   The prevalence of obesity in the world is rising, espe-cially in industrialized countries. It contributes to a signifi-cant increase in CVD|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|5|ea51ba47c5de47ccba8998a708807f50
It contributes to a signifi-cant increase in CVD morbidity. The sedentary lifestyle and bad nutrition habits are the cause of obesity. Obesity is asso-ciated with CVD mortality. There is a linear association of body mass index (BMI), obesity and especially abdominal thickness with total mortality. The lowest mortality rate in BMI ranges from 20 to 25 kg/m2 [12].  The effects of obesity are the following [12]: 1. Increased insulin resistance. 2. Increased systemic inflammation and prothrombotic|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|5|73389fe7dc8446da9c9bbf90b4b107df
Increased systemic inflammation and prothrombotic effect. 3. Dyslipidemia. 4. Albuminuria. 5. Disorder of the cardiovascular system (endothelial dysfunction, coronary heart disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, stroke, systolic and diastolic left heart failure, increased sympathetic activity).  The most important is obesity prevention at the earliest age. Education and media influence are important in the pre-vention of child obesity. Each kindergarten, school, and working environment|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|5|3d0c8537d6e24a54a941320d70aae4e0
kindergarten, school, and working environment should provide a healthy environment and healthy meals. Already in childhood, physical activity should be promoted. In schools should be provided mini-mum 30 minutes and an optimum 60 minutes physical activ-ity per day. Each person should be moderately physically active at least 150 minutes a week or more intense physically active 75 minutes a week [8].  The basis of obesity treatment is diet, physical activity, lifestyle changes. Often, these|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|5|51d7da0ab722484dae29a24323422e50
activity, lifestyle changes. Often, these measures are unsuccessful in long-term treatment. In cases of BMI >40 kg/m2 or BMI >35 kg/m2 with the presence of comorbidities leading the patients into a high risk group, including pharmacotherapy (orlistat) or bariatric surgery is recommended, along with changes of  bad lifestyle habits [8]. 4.6. Lipids  In blood plasma lipids (cholesterol and triglycerides) circulate as lipoproteins associated with proteins (apolipo-proteins). Most of the|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|5|d003fcb45fd3417b87138a5a57580936
with proteins (apolipo-proteins). Most of the circulating cholesterol is in the form of LDL cholesterol (atherogenic) that is directly associated with CVD risk. Hypercholesterolemia is an indicator of increased risk. There is a positive association between total LDL cho-lesterol and CVD [8, 12, 13, 41].  The role of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein is actively studied. These are chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) that can lead to pancreatitis at high concentrations [8, 12, 13].|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|5|d2a40f62bb6849f08e1dac7dd9dc1525
pancreatitis at high concentrations [8, 12, 13].  Disturbed lipid metabolism leads to dyslipidemia, which alone or in interaction with other CVD risk factors, leads to atherosclerosis and consequently CVD. Dyslipidemia can also have genetic predisposition (hereditary dyslipidemia), can be an integral part of other diseases (secondary dyslipi-demia), but are mostly the result of external factors (diet rich in saturated fats and carbohydrates, reduced body activity, smoking, stress) [4].  There|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|5|eb5aad42a1344cd883bd687c151859ed
body activity, smoking, stress) [4].  There are a number of clinical studies that have proven that cholesterol reduction leads to a reduction in coronary events [12, 42]. The most significant are the following stud-ies [12]: 1) Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S) [43]. 2) Long-term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischaemic Disease (LIPID) [44]. 3) Cholesterol and Recurrent Events (CARE) [45]. 4) Heart Protection Study (HPS) [46]. 5) West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|5|f26a7825206b41f09ff04e78e8d0d51a
5) West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study (WO-SCOPS) [47]. 6) Heart AIR Force Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Protection Study (AFCAPS/TexCAPS) [48].  These studies evaluated cardiac patients with hypercho-lesterolemia. They have demonstrated a positive effect of hypolipemic therapy in the prevention of myocardial infarc-tion and/or cardiac death [27].  For asymptomatic individuals, the first step is an estimate of total CVD risk. Within the scope of CVD risk protocols, lipid analysis is|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|5|298d84df88a443de9097e4f306b0da21
scope of CVD risk protocols, lipid analysis is recommended [4, 13]: - Total Cholesterol (TC). - Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL)-Cholesterol (LDL-C). - Triglycerides (TG). - HDL Cholesterol (HDL-C).|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|5|03f4fc21f5474c4791a2c8fabaf0bb4b
CVD Measurable Risk Factors Current Cardiology Reviews, 2018, Vol. 14, No. 3     159 - Non HDL cholesterol - alternative risk factors (mixed dyslipidemia, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, chronic kidney disease). - Lipoprotein (A) - high CVD risk and positive family history of early CVD. - APO B - alterative marker (mixed dyslipidemia, dia-betes, metabolic syndrome, chronic kidney disease). - The ratio APO B/APO A (alternative to the probing). - The ratio of non HDL C / HDL C (alternative in|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|6|ac1d109f1f6341eba87a941f6fb313c7
- The ratio of non HDL C / HDL C (alternative in prob-ing).  LDL C and TC are closely related to CVD risk. LDL C is an indicator to therapy response and its values are monitored during treatment. It is recommended that appropriate LDL C target values be achieved for each patient category [12, 13]: 1. Very high CVD risk (CVD, diabetes mellitus type 2 over 40 years and 1 or more risk factors or target or-gan damage, diabetes mellitus type 1 with target or-gan damage, moderate to severe chronic|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|6|6007a08811fc4e268d85b7599d6e86d0
target or-gan damage, moderate to severe chronic kidney dis-ease, SCORE >10%) - target LDL C <1.8mmol/l and/or >50% LDL C if the target LDL C values can-not be achieved. 2. High CVD risk (diabetes mellitus type 2 without other risk factors or target organ damage, significantly high individual risk factors, SCORE >5% and less than 10%) - target LDL K <2.5mmol/l. 3. Moderate CVD risk (SCORE >1% and less than 5%) - target LDL C <3.0mmol/l.  Hypertriglyceridemia is also a risk factor for the|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|6|cc754f985ecf4c0c9855cd554a619d8c
is also a risk factor for the devel-opment of CVD. It is a significant independent CVD risk factor, but in relation to hypercholesterolemia, it is less asso-ciated with CVD [12, 48]. Possible causes of hypertriglyc-eridemia include obesity, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), alcohol consumption, simple carbohy-drate-rich diets, chronic kidney disease, hypothyroidism, pregnancy, autoimmune diseases, drugs (corticosteroids, estrogens, tamoxifen, beta blockers, thiazides,|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|6|ed3cfe313ea244bc8af25a2b4a4dbeb4
estrogens, tamoxifen, beta blockers, thiazides, isotretinoin, cyclosporine, antiretroviral drugs, psychotropic drugs), but also genetic predisposition [4]. 5. THERAPY OF DYSLIPIDEMIA 5.1. Hypercholesterolemia  General strategies for treatment [4]: - Assess the total CVD risk. - Involve patients in deciding on risk management. - Assess the target value of LDL C for the risk level. - Calculate the percentage reduction of the LDL C needed to achieve this goal. - Select a statin that can achieve|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|6|8657b622efd045b090448634e77f2d83
this goal. - Select a statin that can achieve this reduction. - The dose titration of the drug is required to reach the target values of LDL C because the response to the treatment of statins is different. - Consider introducing a combination of drugs if the statins do not reach the LDL target value. - Take into account the clinical condition of the pa-tient, possible drug interactions that the patient is taking, statin intolerance.  Recommendations for pharmacological treatment of|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|6|c9673cee378c44f781f15d1d05943593
Recommendations for pharmacological treatment of hy-percholesterolemia [4]: - To give statin at the highest dose the patient toler-ates to achieve the target values of LDL C. - In the case of non toleration, administer ionic ex-changers or nicotinic acid. - In the case of non toleration also consider choles-terol absorption inhibitors, alone or in combination with ion exchangers or nicotinic acid. - If the target values of LDL C are not reached, con-sider statin in combination with a|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|6|fab1a3c2c27e441bad76001cc5699b23
reached, con-sider statin in combination with a cholesterol or nicotinic acid absorption inhibitor.  Reduction of 1 mmol/l LDL cholesterol leads to 20-25% reduction in CV mortality and nonfatal myocardial infarction [12, 42]. 5.2. Hypertriglyceridemia  In the case of patients with high total CV risk and TG >2.3 mmol/l which cannot be reduced by changing lifestyle, the following medications should be given [5]: fibrate, nia-cin, niacin + laropiprant, omega 3 fatty acid, statin + nico-tinic acid,|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|6|ebb76dac985843768e4e14242a6e7bbe
omega 3 fatty acid, statin + nico-tinic acid, statin + fibrate, omega-3 fatty acids combinations. Low HDL cholesterol is a factor associated with CVD risk [8, 12, 13, 49].  Physical activities and other healthy habits increase HDL cholesterol [8].  In mixed dyslipidemia (increased cholesterol and triglyc-erides) is important to combine therapy.  Special groups of dyslipidemia patients who need to re-ceive statin [40]: 1. Familial hypercholesterolemia (should receive high doses of statin, often|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|6|329a827e19924d3c9b34c639a890adc9
(should receive high doses of statin, often in combination with ezetimibe). 2. Elderly people if they have a proven CVD. 3. Diabetics (type 1 and microalbuminuria and/or kidney disease, type 2 and CVD or chronic renal disease or older than 40g with 1 or more CVD risk factors or target organ damage, type 2 without additional risk factors LDL C should have < 2.6 mmol/l). 4. Patients with acute coronary syndrome and those pre-paring for percutaneous coronary intervention. 5. Severe renal disease.|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|6|110bc4fe8f0442ae8dd3696a0f27d34c
coronary intervention. 5. Severe renal disease. 6. Peripheral arterial disease. 7. Primary stroke prevention if a patient with high or very high risk and secondary stroke prevention. 6. DIABETES MELLITUS  In 2011, 52 million Europeans aged 20-79 were suffering from type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Until 2030, 64 mil-lion people in Europe will suffer from T2DM. This is a wor-rying fact because most diabetics die for CVD [6].|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|6|d7c1e1b3b9b2404b8ff64bb6535bc0a8

According to the ESC guidelines [12] there are diagnos-tic criteria set by the World Health Organization (WHO) and those designated by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) in diagnosing"|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|7|08fae885ef264a208f65359c4bf8c687
American Diabetes Association (ADA) in diagnosing diabetes, glucose intolerance and glu-cose maturation disorder:  Diabetes mellitus: HbA1c ≥6.5% (WHO, ADA), GUK starving ≥7.0mmol / l (WHO, ADA), glucose after 2h of a meal ≥11 mmol/l (WHO, ADA);   Glucose intolerance (GI): GUK starving<7mmol/l (WHO, ADA), glucose after 2h of the meal ≥7.8 - <11.1mmol/l (WHO) and 7.8-11mmol/l (ADA);  Glucose maturation disorder: GUK starving 6.1- 6.9mmol/l (WHO) and 5.6 -6.9mmol/l (ADA), glucose after 2h of the|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|7|bee368f5ceb448a58ac0ded4cfeea051
and 5.6 -6.9mmol/l (ADA), glucose after 2h of the meal <7.8mmol/l (WHO), and ADA no states the criterion.  In GI cases, it is important to modify lifestyle habits (regulating body weight, increasing body activity and adopt-ing healthy eating habits) to prevent DM and CVD from de-veloping or its progression [6].  People with DM are at high risk and do not evaluate their risk with the SCORE table.  According to the last European Guidelines for Diabetes (ESC/EASD), it is recommended to establish|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|7|050784499b934a39bfd1a2718266fba3
(ESC/EASD), it is recommended to establish patient centres [6]. These centres would support patients in achieving healthy living habits and advice on improving their own dis-ease management and treatment. Such centres would have a multidisciplinary approach [6].  The ESC/European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) guidelines on diabetes in order to prevent CVD give the following recommendations [6, 8]: - Target HbA1c should be <7%. - Statins therapy. - Avoid hypoglycemia, as well as|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|7|dd3fd872a6c1463883b4f0f5e6822ef1
Statins therapy. - Avoid hypoglycemia, as well as increase body weight. - In the first line of DM treatment give metformin. - Further reduction of HbA1c <6.5% can reduce the risk of microvascular events. - Target BP <140/85mmHg. - Target LDL <2.5mmol/l (in case of very high risk of LDL <1.8 mmol/l), target cholesterol <4.5mmol/l. - Key recommendations in diabetic treatment [6, 8]: - Intensive treatment of hypertriglyceridemia reduces the CVD risk. - Intensive AH treatment reduces the CVD risk.|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|7|c4fdd27fab41424c87dc17f590319cb5
- Intensive AH treatment reduces the CVD risk. - It is often necessary to include more antihypertensive drugs in the therapy to achieve the target BP.  Each risky CVD factor in diabetes should be treated ac-cording to the existing recommendations [6, 8]. 7. PSYCHOSOCIAL FACTORS  Low socioeconomic status, lack of social support, stress, depression, anxiety, and type D personality increase the risk of high risk for the disease [12, 50-53]. These factors also make difficult the treatment of|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|7|8fb20871452e4b609ac907d5aa37eda1
factors also make difficult the treatment of cardiovascular patients, as well as the impact on the change of bad habits [8].  The risk factors are the following [8, 52, 53]: 1) Low socioeconomic status - includes low level of education, low financial income, low level of business status, poor living environment. It leads to an increase in CVD mortality. 2) Social isolation and low social support - people who live isolated from society have an increased risk of premature deaths, as well as a|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|7|bccad3066d084ce2b0a98fb5c9617b8e
increased risk of premature deaths, as well as a weaker prognosis of CVD. 3) Work or family stress - increases the risk of CVD. 4) Depression - increases the incidence of CVD and ex-acerbates the prognosis of the disease. 5) Anxiety - increases the risk of CVD. 6) D type of distress - those with negative affectivity, so-cial inhibition - has a poorer prognosis of CVD.  The biggest problem in evaluating psychosocial factors is the fact that they are more difficult to measure, so it is more|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|7|1abbde54648d4564a51a62d5baea576d
they are more difficult to measure, so it is more difficult to define the relationship.  Poor psychosocial factors are often associated with higher incidence of smoking, poor eating habits, decreased physical activity, and consequently greater risk of CVD. Such patients are more difficult to accept medical advice and treatment. The exact pathophysiological effect of psychoso-cial factors is still being investigated [8].  Interviews or questionnaires should assess psychosocial risk factors [1].|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|7|576c1616199a41c59ce7f984e21d4fc5
should assess psychosocial risk factors [1]. The interview should be done by a doctor. In order to remove stress, depression, anxiety, and adopt healthy living habits, psychosocial interventions are needed. According to the ESC guidelines, the following recommen-dations are on the management of psychosocial factors [9]: - Multimodal behavioural interventions, health educa-tion, physical activity, psychological therapy when needed. - In the case of clinical symptoms of depression, anxi-ety|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|7|2e740c01b5664ccf981b0e0f519a4623
case of clinical symptoms of depression, anxi-ety should be applied to psychotherapy and pharma-cotherapy. - Interventions include individual and group counseling on psychosocial risk factors and how to cope with the disease; Cognitive-behavioural therapy, stress man-agement programs, meditation, autogenic training, yoga, breathing exercises, muscular relaxation. Psy-chological interventions reduce stress, promote healthy habits, and affect CVD prevention and treat-ment. CONCLUSION  In our|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|7|a47689271cde4f27991ef0a9fb9a037f

All health care professionals should be involved in CVD prevention, and all preventive activities should be started by family phy-sicians. A family medicine practitioner is the one who needs to start, coordinate and permanently monitor his/her|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|8|94a91678c8d247e3a875ab8a6aaaf69f
start, coordinate and permanently monitor his/her patient's CVD prevention. Thus regrettably, many patients remain undiagnosed, and therefore without adequate therapy. Unfor-tunately, the first manifestation of CVD is sudden dead at those patients. Also, among patients with already established CVD, many have not achieved the target values of their risk factors. In primary prevention, just because of the omitted estimates of the CVD risk and the lack of recognition of those patients with high|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|8|f666ab149e394f49a8622da34e80c850
lack of recognition of those patients with high and very high risk, no adequate pre-ventive measures or therapies are implemented. These pa-tients are endangered by the development of complications of illness or fatal CVD outcomes.  In Europe, from 1995 to 2014, 4 clinical studies of EU-ROSPIRE I-IV (Including the Republic of Croatia) investi-gated the implementation of the ESC guidelines for CVD prevention in practice. They have shown that at the level of Europe they do not achieve the target|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|8|ad245ce7d36647338ad96c233b8307b0
level of Europe they do not achieve the target values of risk factors in primary and secondary prevention. According to the EU-ROSPIRE III study, only 36-57% of GPs in Europe comply with the CVD prevention guidelines and less than 50% of them assess the overall risk of their patients.  Today, an insufficient number of doctors in their daily practice use the SCORE table to estimate CVD risk (62% do not use it, but rely on a subjective assessment). There are several reasons: government policies|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|8|18ab561b17df470f90ea43b34194183c
There are several reasons: government policies and local community polices, lack of time in work with a patient (over-burdening physicians, insufficient number of cardiologists), SCORE table not implemented through information technology, etc.  Individual approach to CVD prevention begins with a CVD risk assessment: the higher the risk, the prevention measures need to be more intense. Clinicians are important to make a quick CVD assessment. It is especially important in this assessment to|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|8|a3405e177a96487eb2d71627539054fa
It is especially important in this assessment to identify patients with an unrecognized CVD. It would be ideal for all adults to have an estimated risk of CVD. A risk assessment of CVD should be repeated every 5 years for persons without proven CVD. In that sense, cardiologists in outpatient practice have an important role in CVD prevention, and need to be consultants of family medi-cine practitioners and general internists.  Cardiologists should do medical evaluation of cardiovas-cular|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|8|42ead2f93d1f4894aaa8b479ddc3503f
should do medical evaluation of cardiovas-cular patients. In this evaluation, the cardiologist will evalu-ate the risk of CVD, estimate CVD capacity (non-invasive, invasive), echocardiographic and Doppler artery estimation. This cardiac treatment provides a detailed evaluation and assessment of the risk and disease risk. Although identifying CVD risk factors, basic treatment and counseling about healthy lifestyle habits should be in the domain of GPs and general internists, the cardiologist is|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|8|b12add2060cd4dc481753c7f3279e4ac
GPs and general internists, the cardiologist is a counselor in cases where doubts remain about the need for introducing therapy with preventative measures or there are various contraindica-tions and/or complications. The cardiologist is always in-volved in secondary and tertiary CVD prevention.  Successful management of measurable variable risk fac-tors for cardiovascular disease development will include: recognizing individual risk factors, monitoring them, and assisting in changes in|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|8|4256e862d6dd44c99fef14f83530e125
monitoring them, and assisting in changes in life-style habits that directly affect the defined risk factors of a patient. In addition, those risk fac-tors that can be expected to be the most successful in pre-venting cardiovascular disease development, if corrected, include: smoking habit, increased body mass, physical (in)activity, arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia and diabetes. In addition to all the above-mentioned risk factors, it is in-dispensable to include adequate psychosocial|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|8|4c20221a11fd400786ccd36bc5a9df20
in-dispensable to include adequate psychosocial support as fu-ture stress, misunderstanding and patient inadequacy greatly reduce the results of preventive actions.  The best will be the prevention of the CVD, which in-cludes a multidisciplinary team of experts and the entire community with the support of governmental and non-governmental organizations that will contribute to improving the lifestyle of individuals and the entire community through their activities and legal provisions.  All|data_input/cureus/CCR-14-153.pdf|8|5423dfa2143a4089a99d88eb17b200e9
their activities and legal provisions.  All health care professionals, including cardiologists, need the simplest and most practicable guidelines for CVD prevention in accordance with the national, cultural and so-cioeconomic aspects of their country of work.

with treatment will continue to increase. Aging is an inevitable part of life and unfortunately poses
the largest risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Although numerous studies in the cardiovascular
field have considered both young and aged humans, there are still many unanswered questions as

aging pathways in cardiovascular health. Fortunately, this gap is beginning to close, and these two
fields are merging together. We provide an overview of some of the key genes involved in
regulating lifespan and health span, including sirtuins, AMP-activated protein kinase, mammalian

more comprehensive analysis of studies carried out linking genes of aging and cardiovascular
health, and perspectives of future directions of these two intimately linked fields.

cardiovascular diseases (CVD) will result in 40% of all deaths and rank as the leading cause.

"Measuring the Impact of Aging on the Heart and Vasculature
Aging is associated with a progressive decline in numerous physiological processes, leading
to an increased risk of health complications and disease. By delivering oxygenated blood to
all tissues in the body, the health of the cardiovascular system is vital for health of every
tissue and longevity of the organism as a whole. Aging has a remarkable effect on the heart"|data_input/cureus/nihms374043.pdf|1|17433bfbc9c74f37a59baafcd206731e
"and arterial system, leading to an increase in CVD including atherosclerosis, hypertension,
myocardial infarction, and stroke.3 Aging cardiovascular tissues are exemplified by
pathological alterations including hypertrophy, altered left ventricular (LV) diastolic
function, and diminished LV systolic reverse capacity, increased arterial stiffness, and
impaired endothelial function3,4 (Figure 1). However, the health of the arterial and cardiac"|data_input/cureus/nihms374043.pdf|1|92a571718ede4d25a397194d3063280e
"systems is not mutually exclusive, as each system greatly affects the other. For instance, an
increase in arterial stiffness leads to compensatory mechanisms by the myocardium
including LV hypertrophy and fibroblast proliferation, resulting in decreased cardiac output
and increase in fibrotic tissue.3,4 Heart rate modulation is also affected by age with a
decrease in both rate variability and maximum heart rate.5 Heart rate is influenced not only"|data_input/cureus/nihms374043.pdf|1|4db17bec3b3a4f328b8c18dcb60e70c0
"by the loss of cells in the sinoatrial node (responsible for controlling heart rate) but also by
structural changes in the heart, including fibrosis and hypertrophy, which slow propagation
of electric impulse throughout the heart.
At early ages, the LV diastolic filling rate begins to decline, which is compensated for by
increasing arterial contraction to sustain stroke volume and workload, maintaining sufficient"|data_input/cureus/nihms374043.pdf|1|c0731e724c8145d09ba3c0cb158db8a4

sympathetic modulation of heart rate, and response to β-adrenergic receptor activation all
decrease.4 A reduction in cardiac output due to decline in function with age stimulates the
myocardium to compensate by increasing muscle mass by undergoing cardiac hypertrophy;
although this may provide short-term enhancement of cardiac output, the long-term effect of"|data_input/cureus/nihms374043.pdf|1|0effba81dfbb46478c5b8e23e25cb823

increase in size of individual cardiomyocytes and can be either physiological, which is
reversible (eg, exercise-induced), or pathological which is irreversible (disease-based).9
Hypertrophy in mammalian models such as mouse and rat can be measured with a variety of
techniques including echocardiography to measure LV size, histological analysis of heart"|data_input/cureus/nihms374043.pdf|1|85983fcf1dd24dbca64072f5ef6b16a4

echocardiography allows for the unique opportunity to measure alterations in cardiac size
and functional parameters longitudinally in an aging study cohort.

and arterial fibrillation.4 Vascular dysfunction associated with aging leads to a variety of
age-related pathologies, including loss of adequate tissue perfusion (resulting in ischemia),
insufficient vascular growth or regression (resulting in hypertension), or excessive growth
and remodeling (resulting in age-related macular degeneration). The vasculature undergoes"|data_input/cureus/nihms374043.pdf|1|39cb5956d0524891ae505ee360eb08b6

endothelial cells lose their ability to proliferate and migrate after tissue injury.11
Furthermore, endothelial barriers become porous and vascular smooth muscle cells migrate"|data_input/cureus/nihms374043.pdf|1|5563f49c703d4447894aee39819be53e

inhibiting vascular inflammation, thrombotic events, and aberrant cellular proliferation.13North and Sinclair Page 2"|data_input/cureus/nihms374043.pdf|1|5ddec773000f4746a2130e1aeaa1a7d1

measuring arterial thickness and stiffness in aged models can lead to further understanding

The heart undergoes complex changes during aging that affect the cellular composition,
marked by a decrease in absolute number of cardiomyocytes due to increased apoptosis and
necrosis and a decrease in repopulation of cardiomyocytes from cardiac stem cell
reserves.16,17 With age, cardiomyocytes become more susceptible to stress, including"|data_input/cureus/nihms374043.pdf|2|b362f8f026fd48e88022f93ae76e3159

oxygen species (ROS) production with age results in an overall enhancement in the rate of
cardiomyocyte death with age. In cases when cardiomyocytes undergo necrosis, the release
of cellular components can affect survival of neighboring cardiomyocytes, in addition to
promoting the development of proinflammatory and profibrotic environments in the aging"|data_input/cureus/nihms374043.pdf|2|c6236950f1904af38a37802e7aec67d3

Aging Research Leads to a New View of CVD
In both the aging and cardiovascular fields, it is generally accepted that a low calorie diet
combined with exercise will increase the health span of mammals and that adiposity and a"|data_input/cureus/nihms374043.pdf|3|fcc8f2cabc5a447abb26f493b54c5e67
"sedentary lifestyle have the opposite effect. The traditional view is that CVD results from
the accumulation of cholesterol and fatty acids in tissues, which compromise tissue function
and stimulate the production of inflammatory cytokines as well as ROS. In the past decade,
however, the aging field has proposed that there is another fundamental process at work: a
diet high in calories without exercise may be harmful because it suppresses the expression of"|data_input/cureus/nihms374043.pdf|3|8af3806865bb44e3aabfc0159a58022a
"“longevity genes” that promote cellular defenses against aging and age-related diseases.26
The new concept has its roots in the seminal observation by McCay et al in 1935 that
reducing a rat’s caloric intake by 20% to 40% dramatically extends its lifespan.27 Since
then, the lifespan-extending properties of calorie restriction (CR) have been observed in
yeast, fish, some rodents, dogs, and macaque monkeys, although there are exceptions,"|data_input/cureus/nihms374043.pdf|3|1bbf9f533fd5492cbc61592708a75cb6

mice.28–30 In mammals, CR reduces the incidence of most age-related diseases, including
cancer, sarcopenia, kidney failure, and CVD.31
Whether or not CR increases the lifespan of primates is debated, in part because of
conflicting data from 2 different sites and questions about which types of death should be
censored. Data from human studies indicate that Okinawans eat a moderately restricted diet"|data_input/cureus/nihms374043.pdf|3|5f3edf9d1dfa4c79a66cb40f2527bd16

but also why CR works. The original idea that CR works passively by suppressing metabolic
rate or reducing damage caused by ROS is being replaced by a fundamentally different
model in which CR triggers an active defense response that evolved to promote survival
during harsh conditions (Figure 2). At the center of this response are so-called “longevity"|data_input/cureus/nihms374043.pdf|4|a80f7feaad7e46abab69386f7c85087c

mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), AMP-activated kinase (AMPK), and nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+-dependent deacetylases (sirtuins). Although researchers still
argue about which longevity gene is most important for the health benefits of CR, the
emerging picture is that these genes form a network of redundant pathways and both"|data_input/cureus/nihms374043.pdf|4|c7f83c67d6b04da4a8681d8974489319

control one another is the most intense area of research at present in the aging field.
There is increasing evidence that longevity pathways are not only important for
understanding how CR works, they may also underlie the health benefits of weight loss and
exercise. If this is true, then an individual who reduces caloric intake and starts exercising is"|data_input/cureus/nihms374043.pdf|4|09bb7fb822414ad3adc8a5f739255cae

evolved to keep organisms alive during adversity. Conversely, when an individual gains
adiposity and leads a sedentary lifestyle, they are negatively affecting their cardiovascular

“CR mimetics” such as resveratrol and metformin (which activate the SIRT1-AMPK
